# ðŸ§¥ Invisible Cloak using Python & OpenCV

This project recreates the famous "invisibility cloak" effect using computer vision techniques in Python with OpenCV. By detecting a specific color in the video frame (like red or blue), the code replaces those pixels with the background, making the cloak appear invisible!

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. Capture and store the static background frame.
2. Detect the cloak based on a specific color (using HSV color space).
3. Replace the cloak pixels with the corresponding pixels from the background.
4. Display the final output where the cloak appears invisible.

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
